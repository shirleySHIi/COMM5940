Hi Bernard, I changed the block in this template to the view, which contains four fields, and the menu was changed, you can see my <li><a href="http://dev-shirleyshi.pantheonsite.io/">Drupal page. </a></li> 

<br />

There are three menus, one is for anonymous users with only "home" and "log in" buttons, the other is for authenticated users with a lot of buttons. As a content editor, your menu has three buttons, "Home", "edit_content" and "log out".

<br />

You can click "log in " button to log in. After loging in, you can click the "edit_content" button on menu to edit content. In the meantime, ou can click "home" backing to the homepage to see the content that you edit.
